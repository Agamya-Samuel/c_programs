# College Assignment Code Repository (C Language) 📚

Welcome to the College Assignment Code Repository for C Language. This repository contains various C programs that were created as part of college assignments. These programs cover a range of data structures and algorithms, providing you with valuable examples for your own learning and reference.

## Programs Included:

1. `DEqueue.c` 🔄: This program demonstrates the implementation of a double-ended queue (DEqueue) in C, allowing elements to be added or removed from both ends.

2. `circular_queue.c` 🔘: A C program showcasing the implementation of a circular queue, a data structure that efficiently manages a circular collection of elements.

3. `linear_queue.c` ⏩: This program provides an example of a linear queue implementation, allowing elements to be added at one end and removed from the other.

4. `linked_list.c` 🔗: An example of a singly-linked list implementation in C, demonstrating operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

5. `reverse_string.c` 🔄🔀: This program illustrates the reversal of a string in C, a common task often encountered in programming.

6. `stack.c` 📚: A C program that implements a stack, a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, and includes operations like push and pop.

## How to Use:

To run these programs, make sure you have a C compiler, such as GCC, installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/college-assignment-c
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific program's directory you want to run:
   ```bash
   cd college-assignment-c
   ```
3. Compile the program using the C compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc -o program_name program_name.c
   ```
4. Run the compiled executable:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```
